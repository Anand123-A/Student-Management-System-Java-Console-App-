# Student Management System

This is a simple Java-based console application that helps manage student records. It allows users to add, view, update, search, and delete students, and saves the data to a text file so it's available even after restarting the program.

All operations run through a straightforward menu in the terminal, and student data is managed using basic object-oriented programming and file handling techniques.

## Features

- Add a new student with ID, name, age, and course
- View all students in a list format
- Search for a student by their ID
- Update an existing student’s information
- Delete a student by ID
- Automatically save all changes to a file (`student.txt`)
- Load existing data on program start

---

## How It Works

The project is made up of three main Java classes:

- `StudManagement.java`: Defines the structure of a student (ID, name, age, course)
- `StudentManager.java`: Handles all actions like add, delete, search, update, save/load from file
- `Main.java`: Displays the menu and manages user input

When the application starts, it checks for `student.txt` and loads any existing data. On exit, it saves the updated list back to the file.

## Future Enhancements

As someone aiming for a career in data science and analytics, there are several practical improvements I plan to explore in future versions of this project:

- Integrate a relational database like SQLite or MySQL to store student records, allowing more structured data handling and SQL-based querying.
- Build custom SQL queries to filter students based on criteria like age, course, or name — useful for generating insights or admin reports.
- Add a feature to export the student data into CSV format for easy use in Python-based analysis tools.
- Use Python libraries like `pandas` to perform data analysis on exported student data — such as course enrollment trends, average age, etc.
- Visualize key patterns (e.g., number of students per course, age distribution) using libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
- Create a simple Jupyter Notebook that connects to the exported or live database and presents interactive analysis and graphs.
- Log all updates (add/delete/edit) for audit or data lineage purposes — a useful practice in real-world backend and analytics projects.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal in the folder where these `.java` files are saved.
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java StudManagement.java StudentManager.java
